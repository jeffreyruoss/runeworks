# TODO

## Gemini API for images

- [ ] Is the API key in a good, safe place (not in dist where it will be live)?
- [ ] Code review on new image related stuff

## misc

Code review for the new global padding system

Code review for UI design/images/etc

Update tests

Make sure shift + esdf is in the tutorial (probably right in the beginning?)

Mention k for key commands in the tutuorial

Sandbox mode. Currently all buildings are unlocked? Let's still make it so that you have to unlock stuff.

I think we are using a google font. Can will set this up so that it will work offline?

## Notes for later (don't act on these yet)

Now that we have 4.6, code review everything again and ensure it is all 4.6 friendly

How can we improve CLAUDE.md for this project
