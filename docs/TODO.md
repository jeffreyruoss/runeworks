Medieval fantasy theme instead?

Let's add Claude Code friendy instructions in CLAUDE.md

let's set it up to where you have to manually get stone to build miners

create claude code agents and skills.

How can we improve CLAUDE.md for this project

Let's not have "build mode" (player can always build) but space bar still pause but bring up a menu modal with different menu items. First menu item shows you all of the keyboard commands

don't have the counters above the buildings by default. use "i" key to toggle. Also, when the cursor is over a building show it.
